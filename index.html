Podcast client writen in PyQt4

this is learning project - it mostly does not work
highly unstable and unrecomended
(except you want to help)

curently using:

- python
- qt4
- pyqt4
- feedparser
- sqlite
- sqlalchemy
- elixir

i will probably lose last two dependencies, they are getting to mine nerves
