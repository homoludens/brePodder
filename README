podcast client writen in PyQt5

this is learning project - it mostly does not work
highly unstable and unrecomended
(except you want to help)

curently using:

- pyqt5  ( so python and qt5 )
- feedparser
- sqlite

- phonon (optional, for playing)
- PIL (will lose this dep.)

i will probably lose last two dependencies, they are getting to mine nerves


start with: $ python main.py
